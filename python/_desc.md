### Python

For python, I have a very standard install and data science workflow. I use pyenv to manage versions for general python installs and conda for managing specific projects. I have python2, python3 both installed. I also have jupyter installed for jupyter notebooks. 

In `versions` I explicitly declare python versions to install for pyenv and in `packages` I explicitly list a few packages I regularly use that I want installed on all my computers. Other than that, there's very few additional install requirements.
