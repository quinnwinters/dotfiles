### Tmux

For tmux, I made some decently standard configurations but the binds are biased for my small hand size. For the most part, my configuration code comes from the [thoughtbot course](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux). 

In particular some of the nice sets I put in these files are: 
* a new alias to automatically launch a tmux session on ssh
* change the bindings prefix to Ctrl+x (which I can press perfectly with pinky + index finger)
* some small style changes
* navigations with Ctrl+{hjkl}
* resize windows with {Shift,Ctrl}+{arrows}
* use Ctrl+\ to list panes
* use Ctrl+x => {|,-} to split vertically/horizontally respectively
* use Ctrl+x => b to break the current pane into a new session
