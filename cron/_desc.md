### Cron

I schedule a few regularly recurring tasks with cron jobs to help improve my productivty flow. The main things I want are: 1. reminds for things that I often forget, and 2. automation for things I should regularly be doing 

Currently I create the following jobs: 
* A daily email with all my todo.txt tasks
* A weekly email with the productivity results 
* A weekly update for all things hombrew
