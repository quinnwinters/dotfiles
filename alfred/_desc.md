### Alfred

Alfred is a great utility! I use it instead of spotlight and it makes my workflows a lot better than they used to be. It has some great interactivity with some of the other utilites (e.g. a workflow so you can type `tMagic "task details"` to add to my todo.txt `+Magic` project in the background)

I splurged at one poing and bought the powerpack, so these preferences will not work for the general public unless you buy the power pack and a license key.
