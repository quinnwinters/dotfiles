### Todo.Txt

I use todo.txt to manage my todo list. It's great because of how flexible it is and easily modifiable. I structure my todo lists using the "Projects" tags to organize the content of my todos and the "Context" tags to organize what type of task it is (e.g. do I have to email someone or call someone). 

I also use easy to autocomplete aliases such as `tMagic` to add a task that is for project `Magic`
