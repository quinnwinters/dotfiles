# Setup and Dotfiles

This is a collection of setup scripts and dotfiles that I use when re-imaging my personal computer and making sure that my development environments are unified across all the different computers that I use (work, personal, VMs etc). 

## Usage

The main script here will install and reset things as well. Usage is as follows

```bash
(TODO: quinnwinters)
```

## My core setup

My tool chain is: 
* **Web tools:** Firefox (Plugins for: ) 
* **Utilities/Lifesavers:** Alfred, Magnet 
* **Terminal:** iTerm2, oh-my-zsh (+plugins), vim, tmux, brew
* **Additional language installs:** Julia, LaTeX, R, OCaml, Scala 
* **Scientific/Programming:** Rstudio, IntelliJ, Docker
* **Media**: VLC, Spotify, Anki

I also install other apps that I know are generally useful e.g. Google Chrome, Apple's Work suite, TexStudio etc. That said, they generally stay in the background for me so I added a flag for them so that I only have to install them if I want to.  

### Firefox setup
### iTerm2 setup
### Shell setup (oh-my-zsh + plugins)
### Vim setup
### Shortcut for just the bare basics

## Additional setup for my personal laptop

In addition to the applications that I install across all my computers and setups, I have some additional setup measures for my personal laptop. These steps are only executed when including the proper flags. In addition to my core setup, I have the setup script manage: 
* Firefox bookmarks and plugins
* Google drive filesystem mount and symlinks to main directories
* 1Password

### Firefox additions
### Google drive filesystem and linkage
### 1Password
