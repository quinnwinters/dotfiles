A simple and easy way to setup my dotfiles using dotbot. The config is located
at `install-config.yaml` and the main install shell script is the simple
`setup` file.

## Install

To install, all you have to do is run the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/quinnwinters/dotfiles ~/dotfiles && sh ~/dotfiles/setup
