### Git

Setting up git is pretty easy. Just putting gitignore and gitconfig in their proper places with symlinks and then clone the repos I consider to be fundamental into my documents. I add some greate aliases to the the `~/.aliases` directory to make things easier. Lastly, I also include a gitignore file -- generated using [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) --for my commonly used file types. 

Note that I assume if the script is running then it was already cloned so there's no need to check for an install.
