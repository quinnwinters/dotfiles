### Google Drive

I use Google for a lot of my personal productivity management (email, calendar, video calls, domain registration etc.). Because of this I get plenty of Google Drive space so it has become my de-facto backup location. 

This script links up the files from my Google Drive backup (connecting to via remote file system) and adds some nice aliases that make it easy to work with.
