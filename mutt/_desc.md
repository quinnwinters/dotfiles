### Mutt

I set up mutt for sending regular emails to myself using scheduled jobs. This is extremely helpful because mutt is able to send information local to my computer to my email. 

In particular, I have the following regular email jobs to boost productivity: 
* email me my todo.txt list everyday in the morning
* email me a reminder to mark tasks as done everyday in the evening
* email my a graph of my todo.txt accomplishments every week
