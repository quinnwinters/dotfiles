### Homebrew

I try to manage all my applications via Homebrew and Brewfile. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) allows for easy installs from the command line. 

[Brewfile](https://github.com/rcmdnk/homebrew-file) allows me to better manage this over time. Specifically, it lets you define a file (in this case [Brewfile](./Brewfile)) and then define all the applications in there for easy install and management. 

Even better, following the [documentation](https://homebrew-file.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), I aliased brew so that whenever you add new files, it updates the brewfile appropriately.
