## python.snippets

The Python snippets in the repo are biased towards writing quick scripts
currently (though this might eventually change to include more code snippets for
common data science programs).

### Basic Snippets

Generally speaking all snippets for python that are large chunks of code are
prefixed with `#` e.g. `#script` will auto populate to a header full of script
imports

Current major snippets are:

- `#script`: sets up script annotations and imports common modules and gives
  template script
- `#class`: gives the template for creating a class in python
- `(method|func)` and `a(method|func)`: Setup (async) methods and functions
  (methods are for classes, functions are generalized)
- `#immutable` to setup an immutable property for a class and `#prop` to setup a
  property with getter and setter methods
- `#container` to add the container API stubs
- `#attr` to add the attribute API stubs
- `#context` to add the context API stubs
- `#comparable` to add the comparable API stubs
