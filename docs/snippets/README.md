## Snippets

For snippets, I personally use NeoVim + CoC +
[coc-snippets](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-snippets).

The snippets in the dotfiles project are compatabile with other snippet engines
like UltiSnip, but I do not personally use them so I will not accept PRs for bug
fixes or features if they also breaks functionality for coc-snippet.

Generally speaking, all major snippets (e.g. headers for scripts/programs) are
prefixed with the single-line comment character(s) for that language e.g.
`#snippet` for Python.
